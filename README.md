This is my first real project with Django!

The Wiki project was more of a hands-on exercise, and my previous Flask projects werenâ€™t great.

I spent about three weeks on this project, focusing on making it look polished while ensuring a good user experience.

In the first week, I built the backend.
The second week was dedicated to designing the interfaces.
In the third week, I revamped the interface with the help of my wife, who is a frontend engineer. She created Figma designs and basically became my personal FullStack Overflow during this process!
I know there are still some features left to implement, such as a personal page, product pagination, a chat system, and using JSON for more flexibility. But I think itâ€™s time to move onâ€”especially since this was just meant to be a week 4 [SQL] exercise.

Thatâ€™s it! Now, onto JavaScript to enhance the user interfaces! ðŸš€
